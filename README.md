# Interactive JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This coding quiz was designed for students to practice their JavaScript knowledge. It deploys a message, letting the user know if they choose correctly or incorrectly. If they choose incorrectly, they are penalized seconds from the timer. At the end, there is a form for the user to enter their initials and save their score. Finally, they can see their score and initials displayed on the high score page.
